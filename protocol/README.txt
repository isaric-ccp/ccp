Purpose
=======

This is the generic CCP, intended to be a catch-all pre-approval protocol for individual nations/regions/hospitals to establish in peacetime.

Version control
==============
Each folder contains the current version of the CCP, and a "previous_versions" folder. Each document name should end with the version number in this format:

> documentname_v1.0.docx

Editing software
================
Because of its popularity we use microsoft word .docx format for all protocols. If you don't have access to word, protocols can be edited using free and open source software such as OpenOffice or pandoc.

List of text to modify
======================
The following text strings should be replaced in these documents to include data specific to each region or recruiting centre. The exact same text is used in each document to make find/replace easier.
